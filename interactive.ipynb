However, given this CFR the prevalence in South Korea is so small that the resting rate should be close to 31%. In face we know that about 1-in-170 people have been tested there (huge, but not 31%), weakening the evidence for such a CFR. Other testing rates also seem an order of magniture off. Comorbidity figures are much lower than those reported from Italy."
