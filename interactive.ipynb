    "**This worksheet presents hypothetical mathematical models of COVID -- and it is too early to draw conclusions about which represents the current epidemic. In all cases you should follow the advice of public health authorities to stay at home (for everyone who can) and self isolate if you have any symptoms.

    "I use here the time series of reported outcomes from COVID-19, namely recoveries and deaths in different countries, to estimate the prevalence of the virus, as well as to project its growth. Under most scenarios a significant fraction of the population will be infected in the next 4-6 weeks, unless the latest public heath measures lower its growth. However, there are scenarios that explain the current apparent high association with fatalities, through association rather than causation. So it is possible that COVID-19 is highly infectious (particularly within hospitals) but does not cause significant fatalities (CFR < 0.1%). Of course other scenarios with a CFR of about 1% (high) are also possible."

    "* The Testing rate $f$ assumes totaly random testing in the population that is not a fatality. However most countries do use some symptoms or at least self-selection as a gate for testing. Therefore a lower rate of testing can justify the observed recovered cases and the reported rate of testing may be a factor of 5-10 lower than the one reported here. (depending of how well symptoms guide testing).\n",
    "* We assume all Deaths either caused or associated with COVID are tested, and reported in $D$. However, it is not clear that health authorities are testing dead people, and many cases resulting in fatalities may not have been reported.  \n",
    "* The Case Fatality Rate $\\text{CFR}_c$ measure the fatalities **caused** by COVID-19, rather than the ones merely associated with COVID. The raw data about recoveries and deaths can only be used directly to estimate the latter (association) since it is not clear whether a fatality is due to COVID or something else (but the patient also tested positive). As a result the CFR we estimate can be much lower than other studies, since a lot of deaths may simply be due to other causes (evidenced by high comorbidity, and potentially already high prevalence in some places).\n",
